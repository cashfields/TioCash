<br> The 'fall thru table' is a down and sideways calculation untill the sq root of PS is reached. 
<br> So , after the first pass thru a row of the *fams ; if no factor has been found ; add 30 to each *fam , and look for factors again , repeat until the sq root. 
<br> If no factors found before the sq root , then prime. PS fell thru the table.
