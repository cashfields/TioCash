    Inside this folder are two XLS files that were the point of origin for
making *wildcard and *fam (*family) numbers and formulas. 

    The first file: "Worksheet in prime5.xls" was the version that showed the
way to group the data.

    The second file: "prime stuff2 by 5 find mod 0c.xls" shows the method to
get to color coding of the *wildcard and *fam (family) numbers and formulas.

        *wildcard are: *1 , *3 , *7 , *9 numbers. The least siginaficant digit 
        of a number makes the wildcard value. 
        
        Call it like this: 
        wildcard1 , wildcard3 , wildcard7 , wildcard9
        or
        star1 , star3 , star7 , star9

       The *fam numbers are subsets of *wildcard numbers.

      *fam (*family) 
      *fam are subgroups of *wildcard numbers: 
      *fam1 , *fam7 , *fam11 , *fam13 , *fam17 , *fam19 , *fam23 , and *fam29.
