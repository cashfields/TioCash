    Inside this folder are two XLS files that were the point of origin for
making *wildcard and *fam (*family) numbers and formulas.

   The first file: "Worksheet in prime5.xls" was the version that showed the
way to grouping the data.

   The second file: "prime stuff2 by 5 find mod 0c.xls" shows the method to
get to color coding the *wildcard and *fam (family) numbers and formulas.

     *wildcard are: *1 , *3 , *7 , *9 numbers. The least siginaficant number
makes the wildcard value.

     *fam are: *fam1 , *fam7 , *fam11 , *fam13 , *fam17 , *fam19 , *fam23 , and
*fam29.

    The *fam numbers are subsets of *wildcard numbers.
