Inside this folder are two XLS files that were the point of origin for
making *wildcard and *fam (*family) numbers and formulas.

The first file: "Worksheet in prime5.xls" was the version that showed the
way to group the data.

The second file: "prime stuff2 by 5 find mod 0c.xls" shows the method to
get to color coding of the *wildcard and *fam (family) numbers and formulas.

    <b>*wildcard</b> are: *1 , *3 , *7 , *9 numbers. The least siginaficant digit 
    of any number makes the wildcard value. 
    
    Pronounce it like this: 
    wildcard1 , wildcard3 , wildcard7 , wildcard9
    or
    starwildcard1 , starwildcard3 , starwildcard7 , starwildcard9

   The <b>*fam (*family)<\b> numbers are subsets of *wildcard numbers.

  *fam (*family) 
  *fam are subgroups of *wildcard numbers: 
  *fam1 , *fam7 , *fam11 , *fam13 , *fam17 , *fam19 , *fam23 , and *fam29.
  
  
  *fam pairs
  1) Brothers - seperated by 10
        + *fam01 and *fam11 - parent *1     (|01 - 11| = 10)
        + *fam07 and *fam17 - parent *7     (|07 - 17| = 10)
        + *fam13 and *fam23 - parent *3     (|13 - 23| = 10)
        + *fam19 and *fam29 - parent *9     (|19 - 29| = 10)
        
  2) Cousins (compliments that add to 30) 
        + *fam01 and *fam29 - (parent *1 and parent *9) (01 + 29 = 30)
        + *fam07 and *fam23 - (parent *7 and parent *3) (07 + 23 = 30)
        + *fam11 and *fam19 - (parent *1 and parent *9) (11 + 19 = 30)
        + *fam13 and *fam17 - (parent *3 and parent *7) (13 + 17 = 30)
