   Inside <a href=""https://github.com/cashfields/TioCash/tree/main/00_The_Origin/">this folder</a>
     are two XLS files that were the point of origin for 
      <br>making <b>*wildcard</b> and <b>*fam (*family)</b> numbers and formulas.
<br><br>
The first file: <a href="https://cashfields.github.io/TioCash/00_The_Origin/Worksheet%20in%20prime5.xls">"Worksheet in prime5.xls"</a> was the version that showed the
way to group the data.
<br>
            <!--<a href="https://cashfields.github.io/TioCash/00_The_Origin/Worksheet%20in%20prime5.xls">XlS prime5.xls</a> -->

<br><br>
The second file: <a href="https://cashfields.github.io/TioCash/00_The_Origin/prime%20stuff2%20by%205%20find%20mod%200c.xls">"prime stuff2 by 5 find mod 0c.xls"</a> shows the method to
get to color coding
<br>of the <b>*wildcard</b> and <b>*fam (*family)</b> numbers and formulas.
<br>
            <!--<a href="https://cashfields.github.io/TioCash/00_The_Origin/prime%20stuff2%20by%205%20find%20mod%200c.xls">XLS prime stuff by 05 find mod 0c </a> -->
<br><br>
<br>  <b>*wildcard</b> numbers are: <b>*1 , *3 , *7 , *9</b>.
<br>  The<b>least siginaficant digit</b> of any<b>size</b> number makes the wildcard value.
<br>
<br>    Pronounce it like this:
<br>    "star wildcard 1" , "star wildcard 3" , "star wildcard 7" , "star wildcard 9"
<br>
<br>    The<b>*fam (*family)</b> numbers are subsets of *wildcard numbers.
<br>  <b>*fam01 , *fam07 , *fam11 , *fam13 , *fam17 , *fam19 , *fam23 , and *fam29</b>
<br>
<br>    Pronounce it like this:
<br>    "star fam 1" , "star fam 7" , "star fam 11" , . . . , "star fam 29"
<br>
<br>
<br>  *fam pairs - by 10's and 30's
<br>  1) Brothers - seperated by 10
<br>        *fam01 and *fam11 - parent *1     (|01 - 11| = 10)
<br>        *fam07 and *fam17 - parent *7     (|07 - 17| = 10)
<br>        *fam13 and *fam23 - parent *3     (|13 - 23| = 10)
<br>        *fam19 and *fam29 - parent *9     (|19 - 29| = 10)
<br><br>
<br>  2) Cousins (compliments that add to 30)
<br>        *fam01 and *fam29 - (parent *1 and parent *9) (01 + 29 = 30)
<br>        *fam07 and *fam23 - (parent *7 and parent *3) (07 + 23 = 30)
<br>        *fam11 and *fam19 - (parent *1 and parent *9) (11 + 19 = 30)
<br>        *fam13 and *fam17 - (parent *3 and parent *7) (13 + 17 = 30)
<br>
<br>  Each one of these pairs (brothers and cousins) will have special meaning later.
<br>
<br>  As we start out the pairs that add up to 30 (compliments) will be our first focus.
<br>
<br> In the end , we will take a closer look at the 30's to look for a signature.
<br>
<br> The final folder "99_just_another_30" - is the solution to finding prime numbers.
<p>The next prime number is as close as 'just another 30' from the last prime. Living within the methodology of *wildcard and *fam
	the concept of 30 and the first four primes ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 ) and the multiplication of the first four primes ( 1 * 2 * 3 * 5 )
	is a set pattern to determining  if a number is prime. This unknown number is PS (Prime Suspect).
	Applying the sorts , and seperation , and using color to help delinate different families of numbers. 
<br>
<br>There are parents ; the *wildcard numbers ( *1 , *3 , *7 , *9 ) - any number that ends with these digits. 
<br>
<br>	There are brothers ; any number seperated by ten (10). 
<br>	So , *fam01 and *fam11 are brothers 
<br>	as are *fam07 and *fam17 
<br>	as are *fam13 and *fam23
<br>	and finally *fam19 and *fam29
<br>	
<br>    Then the cousins , these compilment each other by adding up to thirty (30)
br>	So , *fam01 and *fam29 are cousins 
<br>	as are *fam07 and *fam23 
<br>	as are *fam11 and *fam19
<br>	and finally *fam13 and *fam17
<br>
