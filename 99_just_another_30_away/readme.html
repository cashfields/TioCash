<br> <b>the future needs lots of data , look for signature of brothers and cousins </b>
<br>
<br> In the end , we will take a closer look at 'just another 30' . . . .

Inside this 
<a href="https://cashfields.github.io/TioCash/99_just_another_30_away/right_turn_just_another_30_away/30_sqroot.html">screen</a>
are the 'just another 30 away' and the sub-keys.
<br> 
<br>
<br> The 'fall thru table' is a down and sideways calculation untill the sq root of PS is reached. 
<br> So , after the first pass thru a row of the *fams ; if no factor has been found ; add 30 to each *fam , and look for factors again , repeat until the sq root. 
<br> If no factors found before the sq root , then prime. PS fell thru the table.

right turn , 30 away , triangle

Polar coordinates meridians signature and a home for 3 - N times 3×10


a) Compliments 0129 , 0723 , 1119 , 1317 - all make a total of 30
b) Same *wildcard numbers:
             *1 ( *fam01 and *fam11 )  all diff 10 , then 20 missing
             *3 ( *fam13 and *fam23 )
             *7 ( *fam07 and *fam17 )
             *9 ( *fam19 and *fam29 )

c) need eight (8) machines calc each *fam
d) plot compliments 01-29 and 11-19
e) plot diff from 01 to 11 and 19 to 29 for found primes - count the shelf level
f) some other counting system - it is out there
g) next prime is some big X of a multiple of thirty (30) 

h) do same for *3 and *7



?? = ( Ps - *fam ) / 30

 

UnknownPrime = the quantity ( Prime_suspect – some *fam ) divided by 30

 

Anynumber = the quantity ( Number_suspect – some *fam ) divided by 30

 

These will yield some level in the CASH PILE

 

Anynumber is a composite , it will be broken into some subset of primes , these primes can then be applied the ?? formula.
