All the even digits can be sorted off and discarded first.



Next we will move all the digits that end in 5 next to the even digits.  Any
multiple of 5 will end in zero (0) or five (5).



All multiples of 5 can then be discarded.  This leaves the focus of primes
to only numbers ending in 1,3,7,9



These number are unique in that they lay around 5 and 0 numbers.  They can
be represented as 5-2 or 5+2 or 0-1 or 0+1.  All primes will lay near
numbers ending in 5 or 0.




We can further eliminate multiples of 3; 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 . . . Which are one
third of all the wildcard numbers




This leaves 2/3’s of each wild card number.


This leaves the following numbers and formulas.  The multiples of 3 are in
yellow, the odd *3 numbers are in green.  The *3 are odd candidates for
prime.



Here are all of the formulas, and the yellow marked numbers are multiples
that can be divided by 3.



Next sort off all the yellow numbers, we are left with the matrix of odd
numbers that could be prime numbers



Finally, here are the sorted off numbers, these can be discarded.
