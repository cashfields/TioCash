Inside <a href="https://github.com/cashfields/TioCash/tree/main/20_EXCEL">this folder</a> are numerous EXCEL files used to gather information.

<hr>
This XLS file was used to create the final data for 'gnu plot' and 'r  plots'.
<br>

<br>
But the true value of the document is in showing <b>'just another 30 away'</b>.
<br>
The formulas will work for any and all numbers.
The sheet is locked , cell E2 is the only input.
<br>
The table from 0 - 29 is the result of the formula [(PS-*fam)/30].
<br>
<br>
Go one time thru the table from 0 to 31 , enter data values of 0 to 31 in cell E2.
<br>
Column D is all the multiples of the input number. This is a meridian we are working down.
<br>
Watch the progression of the result in the cells of the *fam that satisfy the formula.
<br>
<br>
If the cell is empty , it has a decimal remainder.
<br>
<br>
If it is an integer it belongs to that *fam.
<br>
<br>
The far-right side was used to copy & paste the (x,y,z,c=color) data.
The #P is just a flag to hi-lite the data as a Prime Suspect (PS).
If the #P is missing those data elements were sorted out already by a higher-level sort.
<br>
<br>
The tan painted columns are the first set of primes between 0 and 29.
These are: <br>*fam01 , *fam07 , *fam11 ,  â€¦.  , *fam23 , *fam29</b>.
Note the return value inside the tan columns , these are the unique sub-keys.
<br>
<br>
This is the 'just another 30 away' matrix. 
<br>
There are three levels presented here.
The first is PSL (Prime Suspect Level) = 0 , then PSL = 1 , then PSL = 2.
Each level is 'just another 30 away'.
<br>
<br>
You can unprotect the sheet and have fun.




<br>
<br> In the end , we will take a closer look  . . . .
